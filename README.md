# Picture Tagger, Story Teller
The application allows the user to take photos and draw sketches, and save them in a database. It can generate tags through visual recognition using the Google Cloud Vision API, and can also generate stories based off the tags using an API from TextCortex. My API keys have been omitted.

A video quickly demonstrating features of the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/HZd45grchEA).
